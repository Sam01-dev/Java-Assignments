Question : Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level?
Answer : Multiple inheritance not supported in Java to prevent ambiguity.
         For e.g : Let us take a class C which is inheriting both class A & class B. Suppose if there
         is a method display() in both the parent class then compiler won't be able to understand
         which method it should inherit. Hence, to prevent such ambiguities, Java doesn't
         allow/support multiple inheritance.
