Difference between finally and final keyword-

The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is
executed whether an exception is handled or not.

The final keyword is used for classes, variables or methods. If used the final keyword for a variable, the variable
cannot be reassigned anymore/changed. If used for a class, it cannot be extended or inherited by any other class. and if for a 
method then the method cannot be overwritten anywhere else.
